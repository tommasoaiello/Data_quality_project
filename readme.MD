# Data and Information Quality Project 28: DQ Issue Dependency and ML Task Classification

In this project for the Data and Information Quality course, I am looking into a specific problem in data quality called 'Feature Dependency'. This problem can affect the performance of Machine Learning models. The main goal is to understand how this issue changes the performance of these algorithms. To do this, I am conducting 10 different experiments. Each experiment uses a different scenario. This way, it is possible to see how feature dependency impacts the results in various situations.
